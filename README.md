SQL Project analyzing EPL Transfers

It's that time of the year when football fans worldwide wait anxiously to see their respective teams' moves in the transfer window. Transfer news is so anticipated today that announcements of new signings generate the most website and social media traffic for most football clubs. 
But what is it about transfers that spark such interest? It has to do with the obsession fans have for this new shiny asset that they believe will improve their club's fortunes. Bad teams hope new additions will make them more competitive, while good teams believe these new players will further enhance them and bring in titles. We all look forward to getting new transfers, no matter the team you support.
Football transfers are as exciting to fans as they are complex to predict. Clubs have designed scouting networks and numerous predictive models, but most still get it wrong. They usually overpay for expensive flops or sign cheap players who fail to deliver in the league for reasons ranging from injuries, cultural misfit, tactical misfit, change of coach, and pressure from media hype, to mention a few.

My latest project analyzed 1578 football transfers in the premier league within 22 years, from 2000 to 2022. Loans, promotion of academy graduates, and players with less than ten (10) matches for their clubs were omitted.

The dataset was scrapped from Transfermkt.com and Wikipedia.com in Excel format and cleaned before transferring to a MySQL database. The data was queried using SQL to get answers to the following questions;

1.	Top 10 countries outside the British Isles with the highest number of players in the EPL
2.	Leagues with the highest number of transfers into the EPL
3.	Details of the most expensive transfer for every season
4.	Details of the best-performing transfer for every season
5.	Best and Worst transfer for every club in the EPL
6.	Full details of the most transferred player
7.	Total amount spent, number of players and average rating of transfers by club
8.	Cost and average ratings by position
9.	The average price of English players vs that of players from other countries
10.	What is the year-on-year change in transfer spend from 2000 till date?
